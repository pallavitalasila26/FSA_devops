    "In this activity, you'll solve four problems that build on what you've learned about conditional statements and loops in Lesson 05. These problems will require you to **think creatively**, **combine concepts**, and **explore** different approaches to solving problems with loops and conditionals.\n",

    "## Instructions:\n",
    "- Each problem has a clear objective\n",
    "- You may need to research, experiment, or combine multiple concepts\n",
    "- Test your solutions in the code cells provided\n",

    "## Problem 1: The Password Validator\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Create a password validation system that checks if a password meets certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task:**\n",
    "Write a function called `validate_password(password)` that checks if a password is valid based on these rules:\n",
    "- At least 8 characters long\n",
    "- Contains at least one uppercase letter\n",
    "- Contains at least one lowercase letter\n",
    "- Contains at least one digit (0-9)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should:\n",
    "- Return `True` if the password meets all criteria\n",
    "- Return `False` if it doesn't\n",
    "- Print specific messages explaining which criteria are not met\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Cases:**\n",
    "- `validate_password(\"Pass123\")` → False (too short)\n",
    "- `validate_password(\"password123\")` → False (no uppercase)\n",
    "- `validate_password(\"PASSWORD123\")` → False (no lowercase)\n",
    "- `validate_password(\"Password\")` → False (no digit)\n",
    "- `validate_password(\"Password123\")` → True (all criteria met)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- See the Python documentation page on [string methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)\n",
    "- Use string methods like `.isupper()`, `.islower()`, `.isdigit()`\n",
    "- You'll need to loop through the password characters\n",
    "- Use conditional statements to check each requirement"
