title: "Resources & Notebooks Pages"
---

Added a page for [Jupyter notebooks](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/notebooks) and a page for [resource links](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/resources/) (see the upper left of this page).

The notebooks page will contain a list of any extra notebooks I create during class that are not part of the course materials on Canvas.

The resources page is a catch-all for anything useful or interesting shared during class. Right now it contains links to the environment set up instructions from the second day and a set of 'cheat sheets' for common commands and shortcuts in Jyputer notebooks, VS Code and Git.
