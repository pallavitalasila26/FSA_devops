    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Apply concepts from linear algebra to gain meaningful insight from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, we can treat each row of data as a vector and measure how similar different vectors are. This is useful for finding patterns - for example, finding days with similar weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select only the numeric columns from the dataset: `temperature_c`, `rainfall_inches`, `humidity_percent`, and `pressure_hpa`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract the **first row** (day 0) as a reference vector\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each row in the dataset, calculate the **cosine similarity** to the first row using:\n",
    "   $$\\text{similarity} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|}$$\n",
    "   - You can use `np.dot()` for the dot product\n",
    "   - You can use `np.linalg.norm()` to calculate vector magnitudes\n",

    "4. Add the similarity scores as a new column to the dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sort** the dataframe by similarity (highest to lowest) so the most similar days to day 0 appear first\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Display the **top 10 most similar days** including their similarity scores and weather conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Interpret**: Look at the top similar days - do they have similar temperature, humidity, pressure values? Does this make sense?"

    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Understand statistical data types and visualize interactions between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding data types is crucial for choosing appropriate statistical methods and visualizations. In this exercise, you'll identify data types and explore how numeric variables interact with categorical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify data types**: For `humidity_percent` and `pressure_hpa`, determine what type of data they are:\n",
    "   - Are they **interval** data (no true zero) or **ratio** data (has true zero)?\n",
    "   - For each variable, explain your reasoning:\n",
    "     - Does zero mean \"none\" or \"absence of the quantity\"?\n",
    "     - Are ratios meaningful? (e.g., is 100% humidity \"twice\" 50% humidity?)\n",
    "     - Can the value go below zero?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create visualizations**: Choose an appropriate plot type to show how `humidity_percent` and `pressure_hpa` vary across different `weather_condition` categories\n",
    "   - Consider options like: box plots, violin plots, bar plots with error bars, or scatter plots with color coding\n",
    "   - Create **one plot** that effectively shows the relationship between both numeric variables and the weather condition\n",
    "   - You might use a single plot with subplots, or find a creative way to show all three variables together\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpret your visualization**:\n",
    "   - Which weather condition tends to have the highest humidity?\n",
    "   - Which weather condition tends to have the lowest pressure?\n",
    "   - Do you see clear differences between weather conditions?\n",
    "   - Does this pattern make sense from a meteorological perspective?"

    "\n",
    "3. Create **two histograms** (side by side) showing only these two variables:\n",
    "   - One histogram for the most skewed variable\n",
    "   - One histogram for the least skewed variable\n",
    "   - For each histogram:\n",
    "     - Add vertical lines showing the mean (in red) and median (in green)\n",
    "     - Include the skewness value in the title\n",
    "     - Use appropriate bin sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpret** your findings:\n",
    "   - Why does the most skewed variable have the sign that it does? (Think about the real-world meaning)\n",
    "   - For the skewed distribution, how do the mean and median compare? Why?\n",
    "   - What does the skewness tell you about typical vs extreme values for this variable?\n",
    "   - Why is the least skewed variable more symmetric?\n",
    "   - **Bonus**: Explain why skewness matters when choosing between mean and median as a measure of central tendency."
