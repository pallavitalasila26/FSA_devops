    "     - Can the value go below zero?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create visualizations**: Choose an appropriate plot type to show how `humidity_percent` and `pressure_hpa` vary across different `weather_condition` categories\n",
    "   - Consider options like: box plots, violin plots, bar plots with error bars, or scatter plots with color coding\n",
    "   - Create **one plot** that effectively shows the relationship between both numeric variables and the weather condition\n",
    "   - You might use a single plot with subplots, or find a creative way to show all three variables together\n",

    "   - Which weather condition tends to have the highest humidity?\n",
    "   - Which weather condition tends to have the lowest pressure?\n",
    "   - Do you see clear differences between weather conditions?\n",

    "   - What does the skewness tell you about typical vs extreme values for this variable?\n",
