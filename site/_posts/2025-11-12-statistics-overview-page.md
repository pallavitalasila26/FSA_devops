Added a comprehensive [Statistics Overview](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/resource_pages/statistics.html) for quick reference on descriptive statistics, probability distributions and statistical testing.

## What's Included

The new statistics page covers three major areas:

### 1. Common Descriptive Statistics
Learn about measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), spread (variance, standard deviation, IQR), and shape (skewness, kurtosis). The guide includes interpretation guidelines and recommendations for choosing the right statistic based on your data characteristics.

### 2. Common Probability Distributions
Explore 12 essential probability distributions with visual examples, parameter descriptions, and Python implementation code. Each distribution includes its key properties, mean, variance, and when to use it in your analysis.

### 3. Statistical Test Selection Guide
Navigate the complex world of hypothesis testing with comprehensive tables showing which test to use for different scenarios. Includes guidance on test assumptions, when to use parametric vs. non-parametric tests, and how to handle multiple testing corrections.

## Features

- **Quick reference tables** for fast lookup of statistics and tests
- **Visual distribution plots** (clickable for larger view)
- **Python code examples** for implementing statistical methods
- **Interpretation guidelines** for understanding results
- **Best practices** for avoiding common pitfalls

This resource complements the existing [Plotting Overview](https://gperdrizet.github.io/FSA_devops/resource_pages/plotting.html) page and is designed to support your work in Units 2 and 3 of the course.

Happy analyzing!
